      "You are an expert Energy Auditor and Financial Analyst specializing in the Cryptocurrency Mining sector. Your task is to analyze a specific regulatory filing (Form 10-K, 8-K, etc.) and generate a **Synthetic Energy Consumption Score (0-10)**.\\n\\n**OBJECTIVE:**\\nThis score is for a regression analysis against company ROA. Because mining firm sizes follow a power law distribution, **YOU MUST USE A LOGARITHMIC SCORING SCALE**, not a linear one. We need to differentiate between small, medium, and large miners, rather than squashing everyone who isn't the market leader into zero.\\n\\n**CORE PHILOSOPHY**\\nYou are a \\\"Detective, not Calculator\\\".\\nThe guidelines below are **possible directions and heuristics, not hard-coded laws**.\\n\\n- **Use your Wisdom:** You possess extensive internal training data on how crypto mining works, hardware efficiency curves over time, and financial structures. Use this knowledge primarily.\\n- **Read Between the Lines:** Companies are often opaque. A filing might not state \\\"MW\\\" but might discuss \\\"securing a transformer,\\\" \\\"coal purchase agreements,\\\" or \\\"hosting revenue.\\\" Use your judgment to approximate the scale.\\n- **Holistic Approximation:** If the data is messy, ask: _\\\"How big does this operation 'feel' compared to an industry giant?\\\"_ Is it a backyard operation (Score 1), a factory (Score 5), or a utility-scale power plant (Score 9)?\\n\\n**THE SCORING SCALE (LOGARITHMIC ANCHORS):**\\nUse these levels to calibrate your intuition. The scale is based on Energy Magnitude. Do not simply calculate a percentage of the max.\\n\\n- **10.0 (The Ceiling):** > 1.5 GW (1,500 MW). (Reference: MARA Holdings).\\n- **9.0:** ~750 MW - 1.5 GW.\\n- **8.0:** ~350 MW - 750 MW.\\n- **7.0:** ~175 MW - 350 MW.\\n- **6.0:** ~90 MW - 175 MW.\\n- **5.0:** ~50 MW - 90 MW (Standard mid-cap industrial miner).\\n- **4.0:** ~25 MW - 50 MW.\\n- **3.0:** ~10 MW - 25 MW.\\n- **2.0:** ~2 MW - 10 MW (Small facility or hosting pilot).\\n- **1.0:** < 2 MW (Micro-cap or experimental).\\n- **0.0:** No mining operations, purely IP holding, or dormant.\\n\\n**BASELINE INFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS (HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE):**\\nYou must \\\"read between the lines\\\" to estimate the MegaWatts (MW) equivalent. Use the best available evidence in this order:\\n\\n1.  **Explicit Capacity:** Look for \\\"MW\\\", \\\"Megawatts\\\", \\\"Gigawatts\\\", or \\\"Power Capacity\\\".\\n2.  **Hashrate:** If MW is missing, look for Exahash (EH/s) or Petahash (PH/s).\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. **1 EH/s \\u2248 30 MW** (Based on mixed fleet efficiency).\\n3.  **Hardware Counts:** Look for number of miners (e.g., \\\"10,000 S19j Pros\\\").\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. **3,000 rigs \\u2248 10 MW**.\\n4.  **Financials (COGS/Utilities):** Look for \\\"Electricity Expense\\\" or \\\"Cost of Revenues - Energy\\\".\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. an industrial rate of **$0.05 per kWh**.\\n    - _Formula:_ (Annual Expense / $0.05) / 8760 hours = MW load.\\n    - _Example:_ $5M expense/year \\u2248 11 MW continuous load -> Score ~3.0.\\n5.  **Fuel/Resources:** Look for \\\"Tons of coal\\\" or \\\"Natural Gas\\\". Estimate standard thermal conversion rates if necessary.\\n6.  **Contextual Clues:** Terms like \\\"Industrial scale\\\" imply >20MW. \\\"Pilot\\\" implies <5MW. \\\"Colocation agreement\\\" implies active usage.\\n7.  **Date Context:** Check the date of the report. If it's an old filing (e.g., 2021), the hashrate efficiency might be worse (eg. use ~40 MW per EH/s for filings before 2022).\\n\\n**INVESTIGATION STRATEGY (HEURISTICS & JUDGEMENT)**\\nUse your \\\"Chain of Thought\\\" to triage the filing. These instructions are only suggestions. Do not simply search for a number; look for the _reality_ of operations.\\n\\n- **Contextualize Hashrate:** If they mention Exahash (EH/s), do not just apply a fixed formula. Use your knowledge of the _date of the filing_.\\n  - _Analyst Intuition:_ 1 EH/s in 2020 (older hardware) required ~45MW. 1 EH/s in 2024 (newer hardware) requires ~25MW. Adjust your energy estimate based on the hardware generation mentioned.\\n- **Financial Forensics:** If no technical data exists, look at the money.\\n  - Does the \\\"Cost of Revenues - Utilities\\\" look like millions of dollars (High Score) or thousands (Low Score)?\\n  - Are they buying coal, natural gas, or paying hosting fees?\\n- **Hardware Clues:** \\\"10,000 miners\\\" is a clue. Use your internal knowledge of miner power specs (S19 vs S9 vs Whatsminer) to estimate the load.\\n\\n**RULES:**\\n\\n- **Neutrality:** Ignore whether the energy is green/renewable or fossil fuel. Measure _magnitude only_.\\n- **Missing Data:** If the filing is absolutely silent on operations (a shell company), score 0. If it implies mining but gives NO numbers, make an educated guess based on the company's known market cap or tone, but mark \\\"Confidence\\\" low. Use 0 only as an absolute last resort if the document is unreadable.\\n- **Stateless:** You do not remember previous filings. Judge ONLY based on the text provided below.\\n\\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\\nProvide your response in the following JSON structure:\\n{\\n\\\"chain_of_thought\\\": <string> \\\"Step-by-step reasoning identifying specific quotes, converting proxies (hashrate/dollars) to estimated MW, and why you selected the specific log score.\\\",\\n\\\"estimated_mw\\\": <float> \\\"The approximated value in MW (e.g. 27).\\\",\\n\\\"score\\\": <float 0.0-10.0>,\\n\\\"confidence\\\": <integer 0-100>\\n}\\nINPUT FILE**\\n<div align='center'>UNITED STATES\\n\\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\n\\nWashington, D.C. 20549\\n\\nFORM 6-K\\n\\nREPORT OF FOREIGN PRIVATE ISSUER\\n\\nPURSUANT TO RULE 13a-16 OR 15d-16\\n\\nUNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\n\\nFor the month of March 2025\\n\\nCommission File Number: 333-256665\\n\\nAbits Group Inc\\n\\nLevel 24 Lee Garden One 33 Hysan Avenue\\n\\nCauseway Bay\\n\\nHong Kong SAR, China\\n\\n(Address of principal executive offices)\\n\\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant files or will file annual reports under cover of Form 20-F or Form 40-F.:\\n\\nForm 20-F \\u2612 Form 40-F \\u2610</div>\\n\\nExplanatory Note:\\n\\nLoan Agreement\\n\\nOn March 17, 2025, Abit USA, Inc.

This is direct evidence of a planned mining capacity expansion.\\\\n\\\\nTo estimate the Megawatts (MW), I will use the purchase price and infer the number and type of miners. Given the March 2025 date, it's reasonable to assume modern, efficient hardware from Bitmain. A current-generation high-efficiency miner (e.g., Antminer S21) might cost around $1,800-$2,000 per unit (this can fluctuate, so I'll use $1,800 as a reasonable estimate for early 2025). \\\\n\\\\n1.  **Estimate Number of Miners:** $3,214,800 / $1,800 per miner ≈ 1,786 miners.\\\\n2.  **Estimate Power per Miner:** A modern Antminer S21 typically consumes about 3.5 kW (3500 Watts) for ~200 TH/s.\\\\n3.  **Calculate Total MW:** 1,786 miners * 3.5 kW/miner = 6,251 kW = 6.25 MW.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let's use the hashrate conversion as a cross-check. If 1,786 miners * 200 TH/s/miner = 357,200 TH/s = 0.3572 EH/s. Using the guideline of 1 EH/s ≈ 28 MW (for modern hardware), then 0.3572 EH/s * 28 MW/EH/s ≈ 10.0 MW.\\\\n\\\\nConsidering both the direct hardware count estimate (6.25 MW) and the EH/s conversion (10.0 MW), and the general heuristic of ~3,000 rigs equating to ~10 MW, 1,786 rigs would proportionally be around 6 MW. I will take a balanced estimate of approximately 7.5 MW to account for potential variations in miner pricing/specs and operational overhead, leaning slightly towards the higher estimate given the 'Super Computing Servers' designation.\\\\n\\\\n**Scoring:** An estimated 7.5 MW falls within the '2.0: ~2 MW - 10 MW' range on the logarithmic scale.\\\",\\n  \\\"estimated_mw\\\": 7,\\n  \\\"score\\\": 2,\\n  \\\"confidence\\\": 85\\n}\"}],\"role\":\"model\"},\"finishReason\":\"STOP\",\"score\":-669.5353393554688}],\"createTime\":\"2025-12-02T18:35:41.364191Z\",\"modelVersion\":\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\"responseId\":\"fTEvaZ-dFpDRjMoPgdGnsA0\",\"usageMetadata\":{\"billablePromptUsage\":{\"textCount\":7695},\"candidatesTokenCount\":602,\"candidatesTokensDetails\":[{\"modality\":\"TEXT\",\"tokenCount\":602}],\"promptTokenCount\":2538,\"promptTokensDetails\":[{\"modality\":\"TEXT\",\"tokenCount\":2538}],\"thoughtsTokenCount\":1538,\"totalTokenCount\":4678,\"trafficType\":\"ON_DEMAND\"}},\"processed_time\":\"2025-12-02T18:35:57.463851+00:00\"}\n",

Use the best available evidence in this order:\\n\\n1.  **Explicit Capacity:** Look for \\\"MW\\\", \\\"Megawatts\\\", \\\"Gigawatts\\\", or \\\"Power Capacity\\\".\\n2.  **Hashrate:** If MW is missing, look for Exahash (EH/s) or Petahash (PH/s).\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. **1 EH/s \\u2248 30 MW** (Based on mixed fleet efficiency).\\n3.  **Hardware Counts:** Look for number of miners (e.g., \\\"10,000 S19j Pros\\\").\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. **3,000 rigs \\u2248 10 MW**.\\n4.  **Financials (COGS/Utilities):** Look for \\\"Electricity Expense\\\" or \\\"Cost of Revenues - Energy\\\".\\n    - _Conversion:_ Eg. an industrial rate of **$0.05 per kWh**.\\n    - _Formula:_ (Annual Expense / $0.05) / 8760 hours = MW load.\\n    - _Example:_ $5M expense/year \\u2248 11 MW continuous load -> Score ~3.0.\\n5.  **Fuel/Resources:** Look for \\\"Tons of coal\\\" or \\\"Natural Gas\\\". Estimate standard thermal conversion rates if necessary.\\n6.  **Contextual Clues:** Terms like \\\"Industrial scale\\\" imply >20MW. \\\"Pilot\\\" implies <5MW. \\\"Colocation agreement\\\" implies active usage.\\n7.  **Date Context:** Check the date of the report. If it's an old filing (e.g., 2021), the hashrate efficiency might be worse (eg. use ~40 MW per EH/s for filings before 2022).\\n\\n**INVESTIGATION STRATEGY (HEURISTICS & JUDGEMENT)**\\nUse your \\\"Chain of Thought\\\" to triage the filing. These instructions are only suggestions. Do not simply search for a number; look for the _reality_ of operations.\\n\\n- **Contextualize Hashrate:** If they mention Exahash (EH/s), do not just apply a fixed formula. Use your knowledge of the _date of the filing_.\\n  - _Analyst Intuition:_ 1 EH/s in 2020 (older hardware) required ~45MW. 1 EH/s in 2024 (newer hardware) requires ~25MW. Adjust your energy estimate based on the hardware generation mentioned.\\n- **Financial Forensics:** If no technical data exists, look at the money.\\n  - Does the \\\"Cost of Revenues - Utilities\\\" look like millions of dollars (High Score) or thousands (Low Score)?\\n  - Are they buying coal, natural gas, or paying hosting fees?\\n- **Hardware Clues:** \\\"10,000 miners\\\" is a clue. Use your internal knowledge of miner power specs (S19 vs S9 vs Whatsminer) to estimate the load.\\n\\n**RULES:**\\n\\n- **Neutrality:** Ignore whether the energy is green/renewable or fossil fuel. Measure _magnitude only_.\\n- **Missing Data:** If the filing is absolutely silent on operations (a shell company), score 0. If it implies mining but gives NO numbers, make an educated guess based on the company's known market cap or tone, but mark \\\"Confidence\\\" low. Use 0 only as an absolute last resort if the document is unreadable.\\n- **Stateless:** You do not remember previous filings. Judge ONLY based on the text provided below.\\n\\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\\nProvide your response in the following JSON structure:\\n{\\n\\\"chain_of_thought\\\": <string> \\\"Step-by-step reasoning identifying specific quotes, converting proxies (hashrate/dollars) to estimated MW, and why you selected the specific log score.\\\",\\n\\\"estimated_mw\\\": <float> \\\"The approximated value in MW (e.g. 27).\\\",\\n\\\"score\\\": <float 0.0-10.0>,\\n\\\"confidence\\\": <integer 0-100>\\n}\\nINPUT FILE**\\n<div align='center'>UNITED STATES\\n\\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\n\\nWashington, D.C. 20549\\n\\nFORM 6-K\\n\\nREPORT OF FOREIGN PRIVATE ISSUER\\n\\nPURSUANT TO RULE 13a-16 OR 15d-16\\n\\nUNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\n\\nFor the month of March 2025\\n\\nCommission File Number: 333-256665\\n\\nAbits Group Inc\\n\\nLevel 24 Lee Garden One 33 Hysan Avenue\\n\\nCauseway Bay\\n\\nHong Kong SAR, China\\n\\n(Address of principal executive offices)\\n\\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant files or will file annual reports under cover of Form 20-F or Form 40-F.:\\n\\nForm 20-F \\u2612 Form 40-F \\u2610</div>\\n\\nExplanatory Note:\\n\\nLoan Agreement\\n\\nOn March 17, 2025, Abit USA, Inc.
