         "\"The filing from March 2025 indicates that Abit USA, a subsidiary of Abits Group Inc, entered into a purchase agreement with Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited to acquire \\\"HASH Super Computing Servers\\\" for $3,214,800.00, specifically for its cryptocurrency mining operations. This is direct evidence of a planned mining capacity expansion.\\n\\nTo estimate the Megawatts (MW), I will use the purchase price and infer the number and type of miners. Given the March 2025 date, it's reasonable to assume modern, efficient hardware from Bitmain. A current-generation high-efficiency miner (e.g., Antminer S21) might cost around $1,800-$2,000 per unit (this can fluctuate, so I'll use $1,800 as a reasonable estimate for early 2025). \\n\\n1.  **Estimate Number of Miners:** $3,214,800 / $1,800 per miner \\u2248 1,786 miners.\\n2.  **Estimate Power per Miner:** A modern Antminer S21 typically consumes about 3.5 kW (3500 Watts) for ~200 TH/s.\\n3.  **Calculate Total MW:** 1,786 miners * 3.5 kW/miner = 6,251 kW = 6.25 MW.\\n\\nAlternatively, let's use the hashrate conversion as a cross-check. If 1,786 miners * 200 TH/s/miner = 357,200 TH/s = 0.3572 EH/s. Using the guideline of 1 EH/s \\u2248 28 MW (for modern hardware), then 0.3572 EH/s * 28 MW/EH/s \\u2248 10.0 MW.\\n\\nConsidering both the direct hardware count estimate (6.25 MW) and the EH/s conversion (10.0 MW), and the general heuristic of ~3,000 rigs equating to ~10 MW, 1,786 rigs would proportionally be around 6 MW. I will take a balanced estimate of approximately 7.5 MW to account for potential variations in miner pricing/specs and operational overhead, leaning slightly towards the higher estimate given the 'Super Computing Servers' designation.\\n\\n**Scoring:** An estimated 7.5 MW falls within the '2.0: ~2 MW - 10 MW' range on the logarithmic scale.\"",

         "\"The company, Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP), is primarily a natural resource company focusing on coal, oil, and gas. Its crypto-mining activities are mentioned under 'Other, Corporate and Elimination' segment (Note 18) and detailed in 'Note 6 \\u2013 Digital Assets'. The filing states that ARLP began crypto-mining in the second half of 2020 as a 'pilot project to monetize already paid for, yet underutilized, electricity load'. This suggests an opportunistic and secondary nature to their mining operations, likely leveraging existing power infrastructure rather than building massive, dedicated facilities.\\n\\nThere are no explicit mentions of 'MW', 'Megawatts', 'Gigawatts', 'Exahash', 'Petahash', or specific 'number of miners' for their crypto-mining operations within the document.\\n\\nTo estimate energy consumption, I focused on the 'Additions' to digital assets (Bitcoin) from mining activities reported in Note 6. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these 'Additions' amounted to $7,848 thousand. This figure represents the value of newly mined Bitcoin received.\\n\\nTo convert this revenue into an estimated MW consumption, I annualized the 9-month figure: $7,848,000 / 9 months * 12 months = $10,464,000 in annual Bitcoin awarded value. Using the prompt's heuristic of an industrial electricity rate of $0.05 per kWh (or $50 per MWh) and assuming that energy costs typically represent around 70% of the revenue for a profitable mining operation (a reasonable estimate given their stated goal of monetizing underutilized load, implying cost efficiency, and covering Q1-Q3 2024 including the halving event), the estimated annual energy cost would be $10,464,000 * 0.70 = $7,324,800.\\n\\nNext, I calculated the average MW load:\\nAnnual Energy Cost ($7,324,800) / (Cost per MWh ($50)) / (Hours in a year (8760)) = 16.72 MW.\\n\\nThis estimated 16.72 MW falls into the logarithmic scoring scale category of '3.0: ~10 MW - 25 MW'. This score is consistent with a 'pilot project' that has grown to a medium-small industrial scale, rather than a large-scale dedicated mining operation, especially considering it's part of the 'Other, Corporate and Elimination' segment, which has negligible EBITDA compared to their core coal/oil & gas businesses.\\n\\nThe confidence in this estimate is moderate due to the reliance on financial proxies and assumptions about energy costs relative to revenue, as direct operational metrics for crypto mining were not provided.\"",

There is no explicit mention of power capacity (MW), hashrate (EH/s, PH/s), or number of mining rigs.\\n\\nI will use financial data as a proxy for estimating energy consumption:\\n1.  **Identify Mining Revenue:** From 'Note 6 \\u2013 Digital Assets', the 'Additions' line item represents 'awarded digital assets received from our crypto-mining activities'. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, this amount was $6,139 thousand, or $6.139 million.\\n2.  **Annualize Revenue:** Assuming a similar rate for the full year, estimated annual mining revenue is approximately $6.139 million * 2 = $12.278 million.\\n3.  **Estimate Electricity Expense:** For a typical mining operation, electricity costs can represent a significant portion of revenue. Given the company states it's 'monetizing already paid for, yet underutilized, electricity load', their marginal cost might be lower. However, for a synthetic energy consumption score reflecting overall magnitude, it's appropriate to estimate a standard electricity cost ratio. I will assume electricity expense accounts for 60% of the mining revenue. Therefore, estimated annual electricity expense = $12.278 million * 0.60 = $7.3668 million.\\n4.  **Convert Electricity Expense to MW Load:** Using the provided industrial rate of $0.05 per kWh:\\n    MW load = (Annual Expense / $0.05) / 8760 hours\\n    MW load = ($7,366,800 / $0.05) / 8760 = $147,336,000 / 8760 = 16.82 MW.\\n5.  **Determine Score:** Comparing 16.82 MW to the logarithmic scoring scale:\\n    *   2.0: ~2 MW - 10 MW\\n    *   3.0: ~10 MW - 25 MW\\n    The estimated 16.82 MW falls within the 10 MW - 25 MW range, corresponding to a score of 3.0.\\n\\nWhile the method uses indirect financial data and assumptions (electricity cost percentage), the 'pilot project' and 'underutilized electricity load' descriptions, coupled with the absence of significant capital expenditure disclosures specific to crypto mining (within the 'Other, Corporate and Elimination' segment), reinforce that it's a moderate-sized, opportunistic operation rather than a large-scale, dedicated mining farm.\"",

         "\"The filing explicitly states that Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP) began 'crypto-mining activities during the second half of 2020 as we started mining bitcoin as a pilot project to monetize already paid for, yet underutilized, electricity load' (Note 6). This confirms active bitcoin mining operations. The filing also quantifies 'Additions' to digital assets (from mining activities) as $3,604 thousand ($3,604,000) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This represents the value of BTC awarded to the company during that quarter. To estimate energy consumption:\\n\\n1.  **Estimate Bitcoin (BTC) Mined:** For Q1 2024, the average Bitcoin price fluctuated. Using a conservative average price of approximately $60,000 per BTC during this period, the company mined approximately $3,604,000 / $60,000/BTC = 60.07 BTC. This averages to about 20 BTC per month.\\n\\n2.  **Estimate Hashrate (EH/s):** The average Bitcoin network hashrate during Q1 2024 was around 550 EH/s. The daily block reward before the April halving was 6.25 BTC, leading to roughly 900 BTC mined per day across the network (144 blocks/day * 6.25 BTC/block). So, the total network generated approximately 27,360 BTC per month (900 BTC/day * ~30.4 days/month). ARLP's share of the network hashrate can be estimated as (20 BTC/month) / (27,360 BTC/month) = 0.000731. Multiplying this by the total network hashrate: 0.000731 * 550 EH/s = ~0.402 EH/s.\\n\\n3.  **Estimate MegaWatts (MW):** Given that the mining activity started as a 'pilot project' in H2 2020 to utilize 'underutilized electricity load,' it is reasonable to assume they might be using older, less energy-efficient hardware from that era. The prompt suggests '1 EH/s in 2020 (older hardware) required ~45MW.' Applying this conversion factor: 0.402 EH/s * 45 MW/EH/s = 18.09 MW.\\n\\n4.  **Determine Logarithmic Score:** An estimated 18.1 MW falls within the 10 MW - 25 MW range on the logarithmic scale, which corresponds to a score of 3.0.\\n\\n5.  **Confidence:** The existence of mining operations and the financial value of awarded digital assets are explicit. However, the conversion to MW relies on estimated average BTC prices, network hashrate, and an assumed miner efficiency based on the 'pilot project' start date and 'underutilized electricity load' context, rather than explicit hardware or direct power figures. Therefore, the confidence is moderate.\"",
