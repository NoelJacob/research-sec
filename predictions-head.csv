./edgartools-data/ABTS/6-K/2025-03-19.md,ABTS,6-K,2025-03-19.md,1583.0,"""The filing from March 2025 indicates that Abit USA, a subsidiary of Abits Group Inc, entered into a purchase agreement with Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited to acquire \""HASH Super Computing Servers\"" for $3,214,800.00, specifically for its cryptocurrency mining operations. This is direct evidence of a planned mining capacity expansion.\n\nTo estimate the Megawatts (MW), I will use the purchase price and infer the number and type of miners. Given the March 2025 date, it's reasonable to assume modern, efficient hardware from Bitmain. A current-generation high-efficiency miner (e.g., Antminer S21) might cost around $1,800-$2,000 per unit (this can fluctuate, so I'll use $1,800 as a reasonable estimate for early 2025). \n\n1.  **Estimate Number of Miners:** $3,214,800 / $1,800 per miner \u2248 1,786 miners.\n2.  **Estimate Power per Miner:** A modern Antminer S21 typically consumes about 3.5 kW (3500 Watts) for ~200 TH/s.\n3.  **Calculate Total MW:** 1,786 miners * 3.5 kW/miner = 6,251 kW = 6.25 MW.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the hashrate conversion as a cross-check. If 1,786 miners * 200 TH/s/miner = 357,200 TH/s = 0.3572 EH/s. Using the guideline of 1 EH/s \u2248 28 MW (for modern hardware), then 0.3572 EH/s * 28 MW/EH/s \u2248 10.0 MW.\n\nConsidering both the direct hardware count estimate (6.25 MW) and the EH/s conversion (10.0 MW), and the general heuristic of ~3,000 rigs equating to ~10 MW, 1,786 rigs would proportionally be around 6 MW. I will take a balanced estimate of approximately 7.5 MW to account for potential variations in miner pricing/specs and operational overhead, leaning slightly towards the higher estimate given the 'Super Computing Servers' designation.\n\n**Scoring:** An estimated 7.5 MW falls within the '2.0: ~2 MW - 10 MW' range on the logarithmic scale.""",7,2,85
./edgartools-data/ABTS/6-K/2025-03-05.md,ABTS,6-K,2025-03-05.md,1353.0,"""I meticulously reviewed the provided Form 6-K for Abits Group Inc. dated March 2025. My primary objective was to identify any explicit or implicit mentions of cryptocurrency mining operations or related energy consumption. I systematically searched for keywords such as 'MW', 'Megawatts', 'Gigawatts', 'power capacity', 'Exahash', 'Petahash', 'hashrate', 'miner', 'rigs', 'electricity expense', 'cost of revenues - energy', 'utilities', 'coal', 'natural gas', or any other terms that would indicate energy-intensive activities related to crypto mining. The document's content is entirely focused on corporate governance matters: an amendment to the memorandum and articles of association and a share consolidation (reverse stock split) to meet NASDAQ listing standards. There is absolutely no mention or even a subtle hint of any operational activities, particularly not cryptocurrency mining. Based on the complete absence of any relevant information in this filing, I conclude that, according to this document, Abits Group Inc. does not engage in crypto mining operations, or at least, none are disclosed here.""",0,0.0,100

The explanatory note explicitly states that 'ABITS GROUP DOUBLES CAPACITY TO 22MW'. This directly provides the total power capacity of the company's mining operations. No further inference or conversion from hashrate, hardware counts, or financials is needed. Given 22 MW, I refer to the logarithmic scoring scale. 22 MW falls within the '3.0: ~10 MW - 25 MW' range.""",22,3,98
./edgartools-data/ABTS/6-K/2021-12-06.md,ABTS,6-K,2021-12-06.md,775.0,"""The company, Moxian (BVI) Inc., filed a Form 6-K in December 2021 stating its intent to \""enter into the bitcoin mining business\"". The filing details an \""Asset Purchase Agreement\"" for $29.8 million to acquire \""certain bitcoin mining assets\"". No explicit megawatts, hashrate, or miner counts are provided. Since the company is just entering the business, no historical electricity expenses are available. Therefore, the primary data point is the asset purchase value. \n\nIn late 2021, the cost for an industrial-scale bitcoin miner (like an Antminer S19j Pro) including some associated infrastructure could be estimated between $8,000 and $10,000 per unit. Using these figures, an investment of $29.8 million would translate to approximately 2,980 to 3,725 miners ($29,800,000 / $10,000 = 2,980 miners; $29,800,000 / $8,000 = 3,725 miners).\n\nUsing the heuristic provided: \""3,000 rigs \u2248 10 MW\"", an acquisition of roughly 3,000-3,500 miners would imply an operational capacity in the range of 10 MW to 12 MW. A specific S19j Pro consumes about 3.25 kW. Thus, 3,000 miners * 3.25 kW/miner = 9,750 kW (9.75 MW), and 3,500 miners * 3.25 kW/miner = 11,375 kW (11.375 MW).\n\nTherefore, a reasonable estimated operational capacity is around 11 MW.\n\nReferring to the logarithmic scoring scale:\n- 2.0: ~2 MW - 10 MW\n- 3.0: ~10 MW - 25 MW\n\nAn estimated 11 MW falls within the 10 MW - 25 MW range, corresponding to a score of 3.0.""",11,3.0,75

I meticulously scanned the document for any mention of the company's energy consumption, mining operations, hashrate, hardware counts, or financial details related to energy costs. The only reference to cryptocurrency mining is in the biographical information of the newly appointed director, Mr. Xu Tao. It states that Mr. Xu has been the General Manager of 'Beijing Jiu Shi Jiu Technology Services Co. Ltd.', a provider of bitcoin mining operations and technical services, since January 2020. This indicates Mr. Xu's prior experience in the mining sector but does not state or imply that MOXIAN (BVI) INC itself is engaged in any bitcoin mining operations or consumes any energy for such activities. The document is entirely silent on MOXIAN's own operational energy consumption. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in this filing, I must conclude that MOXIAN (BVI) INC has no attributable energy consumption for mining operations. According to the scoring guidelines, 'No mining operations, purely IP holding, or dormant' should be scored as 0.0 MW and a score of 0.0. My confidence is high because the document clearly attributes mining activity to a *different* company in a director's past, not to the registrant itself.""",0,0.0,100
